# Google Sheets

## July 8, 2025

-   Made a copy of original 2019 Q1 dataset and named it `Trips_2019_Q1`
-   Auto-adjusted column width to fit contents
-   Froze row 1 and applied bold formatting (column headers)
-   Deleted extra empty rows (365071 and 365072) to accurately search
    for blanks
-   Created new sheet in 2019 Q1: `formulas`

## July 18, 2025

-   Checked for duplicates and white spaces to be trimmed; none found
-   Checked and verified that there were no `trip_id`s that were not
    equal to 8, as each ID must be exactly 8 characters long:
    `=(LEN(A2:A365070) <> 8) = TRUE`
-   Checked and verified that all `start_time`s and `end_time`s are
    either 18 or 19 characters with formula:
    `=(ISBETWEEN(LEN(B2:B365070), 18, 19)) = FALSE`
-   Checked and verified that all `bikeid`s are between 1 and 4
    characters with formula:
    `=(ISBETWEEN(LEN(D2:D365070), 1, 4)) = FALSE`
-   Used **Find** to check and verify that there are no decimals or
    percentages in the `bikeid` column.
-   Applied standardized date-time format to `start_time` and `end_time`
    columns: `2000-01-01 0:00:00`
-   Applied number format to `tripduration` column, then decreased
    decimal places to ensure all entries are *whole* numbers.
    -   Some were whole, some were decimals ‚Äî the decimals only had .00
-   Applied number format to `from_station_id` column and decrease
    decimal places to ensure all entries are whole numbers.
-   In `formulas` sheet, began checking if `from_station_name` contained
    correct bike-share stations‚Ä¶
    -   Process
        1.  In the `formulas` sheet, I used the `UNIQUE` function to
            print all unique `from_station_name`s in column `A`, which I
            named `From Station`.
        2.  In column `B`, which I labeled `Exists?`, I auto-filled
            check-boxes in all cells so I could keep track of which
            stations I‚Äôve checked already.
        3.  I used the Divvy System Map and Google Maps to confirm
            whether the station exists or not and is spelled correctly
            in the dataset.
        4.  Any rows with station names that needed to be revised were
            colored in cyan and had a comment on the station name that
            detailed what needed to be changed.
        5.  Any rows with stations that existed in the past but were no
            longer available OR that needed to be removed entirely
            (trips taken by employees servicing bikes) were colored in
            red and a comment on the station name that detailed what
            needed to be changed.
        6.  The row that I left off at was colored in yellow so I could
            easily pick up where I left off.

## July 21, 2025

-   In `formulas` sheet, continued checking if `from_station_name`
    contains correct bike-share stations‚Ä¶
    -   ‚ùóDespite the station sign in person saying "Loomis St & Taylor
        St", the Loomis & Taylor station is actually off of Throop St &
        Taylor St and was changed to the latter name.

## July 22, 2025

-   In `formulas` sheet, continued checking if `from_station_name`
    contains correct bike-share stations‚Ä¶
    -   Copied and pasted `From Station`s as text to keep the station
        names and remove the `UNIQUE` formula.
    -   Sorted sheet by column `A` from A to Z.
    -   Added `To Station` column (`C`) because I forgot I need to check
        that simultaneously (ü•π). Filled column with `UNIQUE`
        `to_station_name`s from the dataset.
    -   Added `Exists?` with check-boxes in column `D`.
    -   Sorted range of `To Station` names by column `C` from A to Z.

## July 24, 2025

-   In `formulas` sheet, continued checking if `from_station_name` and
    `to_station_name` contain correct bike-share stations‚Ä¶
    -   Station **Ashland Ave & 69th St** does not appear to exist on
        either G Maps or Divvy Map
        -   Accessed the dataset: [**Divvy Bicycle Stations -
            Historical**](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Bicycle-Stations-Historical/eq45-8inv/about_data)
            (from City of Chicago data) to confirm whether the station
            existed in the past.
            -   The dataset shows that the station existed until about
                October of 2020.
    -   Station **Ashland Ave & 21st St** does not appear to exist on
        either G Maps or Divvy Map
        -   Repeated steps for Ashland Ave & 69th St, which shows that
            the Ashland Ave & 21st St station existed until about late
            May of 2019.
    -   Station **Chicago Ave & Dempster St** does not appear to exist
        on Divvy Map, appears as ‚ÄúPermanently closed‚Äù on G Maps
        -   Repeated previous steps of checking City of Chicago
            historical Divvy station data, which shows that Chicago Ave
            & Dempster St existed as a station until about October of
            2020. 

## July 25, 2025

-   In `formulas` sheet, continued checking if `from_station_name` and
    `to_station_name` contain correct bike-share stations‚Ä¶
    -   Station **Clark St & Randolph St** does not appear to exist on
        Divvy Map or G Maps
        -   Repeated previous steps of checking City of Chicago
            historical Divvy station data, which shows that Clark St &
            Randolph St existed as a station until about September of
            2020. 
    -   Station **Cornell Ave & Hyde Park Blvd** does not appear to
        exist on Divvy Map, but it does on G Maps and Apple Map.
        -   G Maps and Apple Map street views show the station name as
            Cornell Ave & 50th Pl instead (May - June 2024).
        -   Divvy Map shows there are e-bikes there, but not a station.
        -   Repeated previous steps of checking City of Chicago
            historical Divvy station data, which shows that Cornell Ave
            & Hyde Park Blvd existed as a station until about September
            of 2020.
            -   [The City of Chicago website shows in 2014 that Divvy
                planned to build a station at Cornell Ave & Hyde Park
                Blvd.](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/bike/news/2014/aug/DivvyExpansion.html)
    -   Station **Cornell Dr & Hayes Dr** does not appear to exist on
        Divvy Map, and is listed as ‚ÄúPermanently closed‚Äù on G Maps.
        -   G Maps street view shows it existed in June 2019 through
            July 2020, but was no longer there in August 2024.
    -   Station **Cottage Grove Ave & 63rd St** does not appear to exist
        on Divvy Map, but it does on G Maps and Apple Map.
        -   Repeated previous steps of checking City of Chicago
            historical Divvy station data, which shows that Cottage
            Grove Ave & 63rd St existed as a station up until about
            September of 2020
            -   G Maps and Apple Map street views conflict with this, as
                they both show that the station was still present and
                being used between May and June of 2024.
    -   Station **Damen Ave & Coulter St** does not appear to exist on
        Divvy Map, but it does on G Maps and Apple Map.
        -   Repeated previous steps of checking City of Chicago
            historical Divvy station data, which shows that Damen Ave &
            Coulter St existed as a station up until about September of

            2020. 

            -   G Maps and Apple Map street views conflict with this, as
                they both show that the station was still present and
                being used between November 2021 and June 2024.
    -   Station **DIVVY Map Frame B/C Station** is actually called the
        **Divvy Service Warehouse**
        -   Found this by searching for DIVVY Map Frame B/C Station in
            the Divvy Bicycle Stations - Historical dataset and
            retrieving the location‚Äôs latitude and longitude, then
            entering it into G Maps.
        -   To be removed.

## July 28, 2025

-   In `formulas` sheet, continued checking if `from_station_name` and
    `to_station_name` contain correct bike-share stations‚Ä¶
    -   Continuing from previous situation of Divvy Service Warehouse
        -   Station DIVVY CASSETTE REPAIR MOBILE STATION (41.895543
            -87.602921) is unmarked, but appears to be related to bike
            maintenance, therefore will remove.

-   Updated column E: `trip_duration` ‚Üí `trip_duration_secs`
-   Inserted new column to right of column E: `trip_duration_h_mm_ss`
    -   In column F, converted all trip durations from seconds to hours,
        minutes, and seconds in this format: 0:00:00

        years with ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù?**

## August 4, 2025

-   Continued from the previous situation of abnormal birth years‚Ä¶
    -   Replaced abnormal birth years with N/A
-   Applied bold formatting row 1: column headers
-   August 4, 2025 10:07 AM **Switching over to cleaning**
    `Trips_2020_Q1` dataset
    -   Froze and applied bold formatting to row 1: column headers
    -   Created sheet `formulas`
    -   Auto-adjusted column width
    -   Adjusted column order
        -   From:
            -   **ride_id ‚Üí rideable_type ‚Üí started_at ‚Üí ended_at ‚Üí
                start_station_name ‚Üí start_station_id ‚Üí end_station_name

                end_lng ‚Üí member_casual**
        -   To:

                end_lng ‚Üí member_casual**
    -   Sorted sheet by column C (`started_at`) from A to Z

## August 11, 2025

-   Standardized column names across data sets
    -   In `Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1`:
        -   `A1`: `ride_id` ‚Üí `trip_id`
        -   `C1`: `started_at` ‚Üí `start_time`
        -   `D1`: `ended_at` ‚Üí `end_time`
        -   `M1`: `member_casual` ‚Üí `user_type`
    -   In `Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1`:
        -   `G1`: `from_station_id` ‚Üí `start_station_id`
        -   `H1`: `from_station_name` ‚Üí `start_station_name`
        -   `I1`: `to_station_id` ‚Üí `end_station_id`
        -   `J1`: `to_station_id` ‚Üí `end_station_name`
-   In the 2019 Q1 dataset, renamed `user_type`s:
    -   Subscriber ‚Üí Member
    -   Customer ‚Üí Casual
-   In the 2020 Q1 dataset
    -   Fixed `user_type` names:

        -   casual ‚Üí Casual
        -   member ‚Üí Member

    -   Inserted one column to the right of column D `end_time`: column
        E, `trip_duration_h_mm_ss`

    -   In column E, inserted formula for each cell to calculate trip
        duration (`end_time - start_time`), formatted as a duration in
        hours, minutes, and seconds (0:00:000)

    -   Applied filters and checked column E, noticed there were trip
        durations less than 60 seconds (0:01:00), some even in the
        negatives‚Ä¶!

        -   [The data set's source stated that trips taken by staff and
            trips that are below 60 seconds in length were removed from
            the data sets they
            share](https://divvybikes.com/system-data), so any that meet
            this criteria must be removed if still present (they still
            are in the 2020 Q1 dataset as of August 11, 2025 8:11 AM
            lol).

    -   Deleted blank rows 426889 and 426890

    -   Applied filters to only show negative trip durations (**Text
        contains: -**); all 116 trips had a start station of ‚ÄúHQ QR‚Äù,
        and 115 of them had an end station of ‚ÄúHQ QR‚Äù ‚Äî the other one
        end station was blank.

        -   Looked up the latitude and longitude of the HQ QR station ‚Äî
            it‚Äôs the **Divvy Service Warehouse**.
        -   Deleted all trips with negative durations because they were
            all taken by staff servicing bikes at/around the warehouse
            AND less than 60 seconds.

    -   Applied filters to only show trip durations less than 60 seconds
        (Text starts with: 0:00)

        -   Started deleting all trips less than 60 seconds‚Ä¶technical
            difficulties ü•îüî®

## August 18, 2025

-   Still in 2020 Q1 Trips: Finished deleting all trips less than 60
    seconds! üéä August 18, 2025 9:35 AM
-   Applied filters to only show trips with start stations of ‚ÄúHQ QR‚Äù ‚Äî
    4 displayed, end station is the same
    -   Trips deleted August 18, 2025 9:40 AM
-   Applied filters to only show trips with end stations of ‚ÄúHQ QR‚Äù ‚Äî 1
    displayed, start station is Adler Planetarium
    -   The trip duration is 62 hrs, 23 mins, and 34 secs, which is
        about 2.5 days.
    -   Trip deleted
-   Trip with an abnormal duration of **2,607 hours, 30 minutes, and 24
    seconds, which is about 108 days!!!**
    -   **WILL SWING BACK TO THIS**
        -   <https://help.divvybikes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033484791-What-if-I-keep-a-bike-out-too-long>
-   Inserted new column C: `start_day`
    -   In column C, filled cells with formula to print the day of the
        week each trip started: `=TEXT(X#, ‚Äúdddd‚Äù)`
    -   In 2019 Q1 Trips dataset, did the same (inserted new column B of
        the same name with the similar formulas in each cell below).
-   Back in the 2020 Q1 Trips dataset, in the `formulas` sheet I printed
    all unique start station names and end station names to repeat the
    process of checking the existence of stations.
    -   NTS: Use the 2019 Q1 Trips station names to help you quickly
        identify which still exist!!!!!!

## August 19, 2025

-   Trips_2020_Q1
    -   In `formulas` sheet, combined start and end station names in one
        column and used the `UNIQUE` function to get all unique start
        and end station names so I can check them simultaneously. Wish I
        did that the first time! The more you know üå†

    and formats.
    -   `bike_id` ‚Üí `rideable_type`
        -   Converted all cells under the `rideable_type` column to

## September 3 to \~9, 2025

> For more details on my analysis done in R, check out this [R
> script](https://github.com/jody-3/cyclistic-case-study/blob/main/Analysis_from_2025-09-03_to_2025-09-10.R).

-   Installed and loaded necessary packages:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(conflicted)
```

-   Imported data set .csv files:

```{r}
# Changed working directory first with command: setwd("path/to/directory")
q1_2019 <- read_csv("Trips_2019_Q1.csv")
q1_2020 <- read_csv("Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
```

-   Converted `trip_id` and `rideable_type` columns to character types
    for proper stacking:

```{r}
q1_2019 <- mutate(q1_2019, trip_id = as.character(trip_id),
                  rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type))
```

-   Merged data frames:

```{r}
all_trips <- bind_rows(q1_2019, q1_2020)
```

-   Dropped `lat`, `long`, `birth_year`, and `gender` fields as this
    data was dropped beginning in 2020:

```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, birth_year, gender))
```

-   Added date, month, and year columns to allow for aggregation of ride
    data by measurements of time instead of at individual ride levels:

```{r}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$start_time)
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day_of_month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
(all_trips <- rename(all_trips
                     ,day_of_week = start_day))
```

-   Converted `trip_duration` to numeric type, with duration in seconds

# Converted hours, minutes, and seconds to seconds only and stored in a new field

# Removed hours, minutes, and seconds columns as they're no longer needed
