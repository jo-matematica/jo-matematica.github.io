        <h2 id="#bike-case-study"><strong>Cyclistic Case Study</strong> (October 2025)</h2>
          <p>This project was one of the final parts of the <a href="index.html#gdac">Google Data Analytics Certificate program</a>. In this project, I was assigned a task to analyze trip data for a fictional bike share company, Cyclistic, to understand how casual riders and annual members used Cyclistic bikes differently. Casual riders were those who purchased single-ride or full-day passes, and members were those who purchased an annual membership. The data used in this project were the trips from the first quarters of 2019 and 2020 from DIVVY's public data bucket. The data was cleaned and manipulated in Google Sheets and R, with visualizations created with R's ggplot package from the tidyverse.</p>
          <p><strong>Key skills used:</strong> Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, Google Sheets, R Programming</p>
